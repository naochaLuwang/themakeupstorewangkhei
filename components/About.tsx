Founded in 2021 by Louis Mayengbam, a former MAC Cosmetics manager in Bangalore and Arvind Krishna, a former MAC ARTIST, THE MAKEUP STORE was born out of a desire to transform the beauty shopping experience in his home state of Manipur. Frustrated by the lack of testers and professional guidance, they set out to create a space where beauty enthusiasts could explore authentic makeup with the support they deserve.
